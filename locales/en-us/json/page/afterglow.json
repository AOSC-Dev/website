    "p1": "Xingxia OS (English translation: Afterglow) is developed based on Antong OS. Through streamlining features, configuration tuning and software selection, it is committed to providing continuous software and technology updates for various old devices. Through continuous maintenance of good experience and performance, old devices are reborn and users \"regain their old love\".",
    "p2": "Xingxia OS supports devices that are nearly thirty years old, such as PCs equipped with 486 processors and Macintosh computers with m68k processors, and also supports newer devices, such as Macs equipped with Intel Atom netbooks or PowerPC processors around 2010. Through configuration tuning and feature grading, Xingxia OS can ensure a good user experience on all kinds of old devices.",
    "p3": "The basic premise for allowing old devices to continue to shine and heat is continuous and complete software support. Xingxia OS provides continuous feature updates and security vulnerability repairs, allowing you to continue to use old devices in various scenarios with confidence.",
    "p4": "We plan to continue to maintain Xingxia OS in the coming years and release update packages periodically so that you can continue to enjoy and play with the computers that have brought you happiness and carved your memories in the early years with peace of mind."
