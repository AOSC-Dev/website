title: System Requirements - AOSC OS
---

AOSC OS is a well-featured and desktop-oriented operating system and, as such, its pre-installed applications and features poses requirements for the processor, graphics cards, storage, and Internet connection on your device. 

Below is a table of system requirements to guarantee good user experience.

| Hardware Component | Requirement(s)                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Processor          | Any processor compatible with AOSC OS                         |
| RAM                | 2GiB                                                          |
| Graphics           | Graphics card supporting OpenGL 2.1 / OpenGL ES 3.1 or higher |
| Storage            | 64GiB                                                         |
| Networking         | Internet connectivity                                         |

## Additional Notes

- For information on processors supported by AOSC OS, please see [*Instruction Set Architecture Support Matrix - AOSC OS*](/aosc-os/isa).
- Demand on RAM and processors will grow significantly whilst browsing the Web - if your use case includes heavy Web browsing and high-definition media streaming, a quad-core processor and at least 4GiB of RAM are recommended.
- As a rule of thumb, when using AOSC OS on a 4K resolution monitor, you would want at least 2GiB of Video RAM on your graphics card.
- Storage requirement takes into account the space that may be required for everyday use after installation. Swap area may take up additional space (especially when additional storage space is available).
- AOSC OS updates via the Internet - please maintain a stable Internet connection for timely system updates.
