title: Is AOSC OS Right for Me?
---

AOSC OS is an independently maintained operating system based on the Linux kernel and various software components, using dpkg for package management. AOSC OS is targeted at experienced Linux users and is optimised for use on personal devices. Moreover, AOSC OS aims to provide good out-of-the-box experience, simplified system administration, and a reliable work environment.

AOSC OS is one amongst thousands of Linux distributions. As such, you might find yourself drowning in choices. This article will help you decide if AOSC OS is right for you.

## Design Principles

AOSC OS is built upon the following goals and principles in mind:

- Keep packages whole (one application per package) whenever possible.
- Satisfactory out-of-the-box experience for users of different language backgrounds.
- Embrace both open- and closed-source software.
- Strong emphasis on reliability.
- Feature and experience parity for different hardware architectures.

## Pros

AOSC OS is a good choice for the following reasons:

- Quick deployment and ready to use out-of-the-box.
- Simple and intuitive system management.
- Strong emphasis on technical support, as offered by its maintainers.
- Good support for closed-source and commercial software.
- Multilingual support as standard.
- Comprehensive hardware driver support.
- Pre-tuned power management support.
- Connectivity aid for Internet-restrictive regions.
- Refined support for Windows applications, powered by Wine.
- Consistent experience across different architectures with well-optimised binaries.

## Cons

However, AOSC OS does have its shortcomings, here are a few for your reference:

- Heavy, takes up more storage than other distributions.
- No multilib or multiarch support, making cross-architecture development more convoluted.
- Relatively austere software selection.
- Limited support for third-party commercial software.
- Longer response periods for bug fixes and security vulnerabilities, as our team of maintainers is short-staffed.
- Pre-installs closed-source and non-free software.

## Suitable Use Cases

AOSC OS is suitable, if:

- You intend to use AOSC OS at home or for personal use.
- You own a suitable device - abundant storage space and stable Internet connection.
- You prefer ease of deployment and out-of-the-box usability.
- You are less sensitive to the speed of software updates.
- You own laptop computers and other energy- and thermal-critical devices.
- You'd like to help maintain AOSC OS.

## Unsuitable Use Cases

We do not recommend using AOSC OS, if:

- You have no experience with using or managing a Linux distribution.
- You are limited in storage or demands high degrees of customisability.
- You demand quick software updates.
- Your inteded scenarios are commercial or mission-critical deployments, or Cloud or Virtual Private Servers (VPS), or other environments with high storage costs.
- You are allergic to non-free software.
