However, since our community is a volunteer community without operating capital, it often requires financial and material support for daily operations of the community and the purchase of large items for specific projects (such as servers for construction and AOSCC annual gatherings, etc.). Therefore, we accept donations of money, items (such as computer cases, power supplies and hard drives, etc.) and services (such as website server resources, etc.) for specific projects and purchase plans."
